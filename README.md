# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This repository contains a Movie Recommendation System built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It utilizes various recommendation algorithms to suggest movies based on user preferences and historical data.

## Features
- Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar to those a user has liked in the past.
- Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on the preferences of similar users.
- Hybrid Approach: Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering for improved recommendations.

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/sandyyman/movieRecommendationSystem.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd movieRecommendationSystem
3. Install the required packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
- Open `movie-recommender-system.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
- Run the cells to load the data, train the models, and generate recommendations.
- Customize the notebook as needed to experiment with different algorithms and datasets.

## File Structure
- **movie-recommender-system.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.
- **movies_df.pkl**: Pickle file storing the movie dataset.
- **movies_dict.pkl**: Pickle file storing a dictionary of movie information.
- **Untitled.ipynb** and **Untitled.py**: Additional files for testing and development.
